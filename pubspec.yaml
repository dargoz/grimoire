# The following line prevents the package from being accidentally published to

publish_to: 'none' # Remove this line if you wish to publish to pub.dev

# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number used as CFBundleVersion.

# consider running `flutter pub upgrade --major-versions`. Alternatively,
# dependencies can be manually updated by changing the version numbers below to
# the latest version available on pub.dev. To see which dependencies have newer
# versions available, run `flutter pub outdated`.

# The following section is specific to Flutter packages.
flutter:

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - packages/grimoire/assets/lottie/loading_animation_bored_hand.json
    - packages/grimoire/assets/lottie/loading_animation_paper_plane.json
    - packages/grimoire/assets/lottie/no_data_animation.json
    - packages/grimoire/assets/icons/grimoire_logo_bw.png
    - packages/grimoire/assets/icons/typesense_logo.svg
    - packages/grimoire/assets/images/grimoire_bg.jpg
  #   - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: SegoeUI
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/seguiemj.ttf
        - asset: fonts/segoeuib.ttf
          weight: 700
        - asset: fonts/segoeuii.ttf
          style: italic
        - asset: fonts/seguisym.ttf
        - asset: fonts/seguisb.ttf
          weight: 300
        - asset: fonts/seguisbi.ttf
          weight: 300
          style: italic
    - family: JetBrainsMono
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/JetBrainsMono-Regular.ttf
        - asset: fonts/JetBrainsMono-Bold.ttf
          weight: 700
        - asset: fonts/JetBrainsMono-Italic.ttf
          style: italic
        - asset: fonts/JetBrainsMono-SemiBold.ttf
          weight: 300
        - asset: fonts/JetBrainsMono-SemiBoldItalic.ttf
          weight: 300
          style: italic

  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:

  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
